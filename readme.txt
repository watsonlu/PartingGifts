Parting Gifts

-----

Wizards now cast powerful curses on death.

-----

In fantasy stories, there's often the concept of a "death curse". When a wizard knows they're about to die,
they expend all of their magical power to cast a curse on their killer. This works as a disincentive
to killing a wizard. You can't just fight a wizard, you have to be wary of their parting gift.

This mod adds Death Curses to Skyrim. Whenever you fight a wizard, mage or a cultist, you'll have a chance to be cursed.

This curse can be something powerful, like fear of the dark, inability to swim or never being able to sleep restfully.

You can cleanse these curses the same way you would cleanse a disease.

You can also avoid a death curse by killing your target in a way that prevents them from casting. You can kill them from a
distance with an arrow, or stab them in the back.
